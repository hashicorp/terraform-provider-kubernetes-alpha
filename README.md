A Terraform provider for Kubernetes which supports all API resources in a generic fashion.

This provider allows you to describe any Kubernetes resource using HCL. See [Moving from YAML to HCL](#moving-from-yaml-to-hcl) if you have YAML you want to use with the provider.

Please regard this project as experimental. It still requires extensive testing and polishing to mature into production-ready quality. Please file issues generously and detail your experience while using the provider. We encourage all types of feedback.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) version 0.12.x +
* [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference) version 1.17.x +
* [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) version 1.14.x

## Usage Example

* Create a Kubernetes ConfigMap
```hcl
provider "kubernetes-alpha" {}

resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test-configmap" {
  provider = kubernetes-alpha

  manifest = {
    "apiVersion" = "v1"
    "kind" = "ConfigMap"
    "metadata" = {
      "name" = "test-config"
      "namespace" = "default"
    }
    "data" = {
      "foo" = "bar"
    }
  }
}
```

* Create a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition

```hcl
provider "kubernetes-alpha" {}

resource "kubernetes_manifest" "test-crd" {
  provider = kubernetes-alpha

  manifest = {
    apiVersion = "apiextensions.k8s.io/v1"
    kind = "CustomResourceDefinition"
    metadata = {
      name = "testcrds.hashicorp.com"
    }
    spec = {
      group = "hashicorp.com"
      names = {
        kind = "TestCrd"
        plural = "testcrds"
      }
      scope = "Namespaced"
      versions = [{
        name = "v1"
        served = true
        storage = true
        schema = {
          openAPIV3Schema = {
            type = "object"
            properties = {
              data = {
                type = "string"
              }
              refs = {
                type = "number"
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

## Moving from YAML to HCL

The `manifest` attribute of the `kubernetes_manifest` resource accepts any arbitrary Kubernetes API object, using Terraform's [map](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/expressions.html#map) syntax. If you have YAML you want to use with this provider, we recommend that you convert it to a map as an initial step, rather than using `yamldecode()` inside the resource block. 

You can quickly convert a single YAML file to an HCL map using this one liner:

```
echo 'yamldecode(file("test.yaml"))' | terraform console
```

There is also an experimental command line tool [tfk8s](https://github.com/jrhouston/tfk8s) which you can use to convert Kubernetes YAML manifests to complete Terraform configurations.

## Building and installing

As we do not yet publish releases for this provider to the registry, you have to install it manualy.

Make sure you have a supported version of Go installed and working.

Checkout or download this repository, then open a terminal and change to its directory.

### Using `GOBIN` and `terraform.d/plugins`
```
make install
```
This will place the provider binary in the GOBIN directory. You can determine this location using the `go env GOBIN` command.

You then need to link this binary file into a filesystem location where Terraform can find it. One such location is `$HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/`. More on this topic [here](https://www.terraform.io/docs/extend/how-terraform-works.html#discovery)

Create the link with following commands:
```
mkdir -p $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins
ln -s $(go env GOBIN)/terraform-provider-kubernetes-alpha $HOME/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform-provider-kubernetes-alpha
```

You are now ready to use the provider. You can find example TF configurations in this repository under the `./examples`.

Don't forget to run `terraform init` in the TF configuration directory to allow Terraform to detect the provider binary.

### Using `-plugin-dir` 

Alternative, you can run:

```
make build
```

This will place the provider binary in the top level of the provider directory. You can then use it with terraform by specifying the `-plugin-dir` option when running `terraform init`

```
terraform init -plugin-dir /path/to/terraform-provider-alpha
```
